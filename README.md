# RetailTrust

A blockchain-powered retail loyalty and supply chain transparency platform that enhances customer trust and engagement by providing verifiable product origins and rewarding loyal customers—all on-chain.

## Overview

RetailTrust leverages blockchain technology to address two critical pain points in the retail industry: lack of transparency in product supply chains and ineffective customer loyalty programs. The platform consists of four smart contracts built with Clarity to create a decentralized, transparent, and rewarding ecosystem for retailers and customers.

1. **Loyalty Token Contract** – Manages retailer-specific loyalty tokens for customer rewards.
2. **Supply Chain Provenance Contract** – Tracks and verifies product origins on-chain.
3. **Rewards Redemption Contract** – Handles redemption of loyalty tokens for discounts or products.
4. **Customer Engagement DAO Contract** – Enables customers to vote on retailer initiatives or promotions.
